# Basic-Banking-System
I worked as a Web Development and Designing intern under the 
internship with The Sparks Foundation. My role was to complete a project 
to build a dynamic website named BASIC BANKING SYSTEM. I learnt 
various front-end and dynamic functionalities which were required to 
build the project and was able to complete it on time.
